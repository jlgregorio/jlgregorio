# Hi, I’m Jean-Loup 🖐🏻

## About me

I'm an engineer and self-taught programmer.

Over the years, I have become particularly interested in digital topics. Loving to learn and discover new things, I started programming a few years ago, mainly in Python and SQL. I've opened this Github page as part of my learning journey ⛵

My interests range from automation scripts & small apps' development to 3D modeling/computer graphics passing by machine learning and deep learning. I've been particularly interested in topics related to pointcloud and mesh processing since my Ph.D. works 👨🏻‍🔬
